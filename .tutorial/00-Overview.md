# Example Code Overview

## Summary of Previous Lab

In our previous lab, we learned about the `p5.Vector` class and created our own class that represented a moving ball. Make sure you understand how to create and manipulate p5.Vector objects, as well as how to build your own class before moving on. 

## Overview of Current Lab

In this lab, we will build on the now-named `Mover` class to provide collision detection using the `collide2d` library. 

## Code Overview

The sketch right now is not too far removed from where we left off in the previous lab. `Ball` has been renamed `Mover` and there have been a few other changes as well.
