# Moving Mover

As you can see from the example code, `script.js` is getting out of hand. We should adopt a convention and put our classes in separate files. 

Make sure you can see the file list on the left hand side. Click the add file icon and name the new file `Mover.js`. Next, edit `index.html` to add another `script` tag whose `src` attribute is our new file. Finally, select the entire `Mover` class in `script.js`, cut it, and then paste it into `Mover.js`. 

Then, bask in the glory of hiding complexity in other files.
